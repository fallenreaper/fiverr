The initial test, just dumps to the console the list of accounts assocaated.

First thing is first:  Go use pip to install the requirements.
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

After that installs, you can edit config file as needed which will have access to relevant globals

Then you can run the application:  `python3 initialization.py` which will do a proof of concept and then create a token json file.
